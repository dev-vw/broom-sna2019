## A Crash Tutorial on Social Network Analysis in R

### Description

This two-hour tutorial is intended for researchers interested in using R to perform analyses on networked data. Social network analysis is used in a variety of disciplines, from sociology to epidemiology.  Given the increasing popularity of using R to analyze social science data, the number of user-created packages have similarly increased. The decision of which analytical technique to use or which package to install is a non-trivial decision, and can be bewildering to a nascent researcher (I’m definitely still learning myself!). Within the context of relational data science, this tutorial is intended to dispel some of these confusions and provide resources for researchers who work with social networks. This tutorial will be divided into four main sections:

1. We will start the tutorial by going through some graph theory basics, enough to lay the foundation for understanding and manipulating networked data. 
2. Then, using toy network data, we will learn to turn this dataset into relational data structures in R, and explore functions that can calculate network measures.
3. Finally, we will end by discussing other useful ways to use R in social network analysis, including respondent driven sampling to population size estimation techniques.
4. After the tutorial, I will be happy to answer individual questions regarding your own research and data idiosyncrasies.

### Prior Preparation

Some familiarity with R will be very useful. Some participants may request to work with their own data during the tutorial. I’m going to kindly suggest that we stick with the toy datasets, simply because addressing issues with data formatting can be a major drain on time. However, I am happy to take questions after the tutorial to address specific analytic questions. So do bring your datasets for the Q and A session after the tutorial!

### About Me

I’m a second year PhD student in geography with an NSF IGERT traineeship in network science. Although my degrees are in public health and infectious disease, most of my work is interdisciplinary and focused on incorporating computational techniques in global health research.
