# Workshop: An Introduction to Social Network Analysis in R
# Instructor: Vania Wang (vaniawang@ucsb.edu)
# Date: June 10th, 2019
# Exercise: Working with large networks, Google plus network data
# Instructions: Using the following comments as a guide, complete the requested tasks
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. load packages

# 2. set working directory

# 3. The dataset, soc-google-plus.txt, is an edge list.
#    Create a data frame from the edge list dataset

# 4. Create a network object called g.edges.

# 5. Print a summary of the g.net network okject. 
#    How many nodes are there?
#    How many edges are in the network

# 5. Print a census of dyads in g.net. How many mutual, asymmetric, and null
#    dyads are present in the network?

# 6. What is the density of this graph? Is this surprising?

# 7. Find the max and min degree of the network. Are there singleton nodes in the graph?

# 8. What are the max in degree and out degree of the network? What about the min?

# 9. Plot a histogram of the total degree. Do some google-fu on small-world networks. 
#    Is g.net a small-world network?
